Umeliko is an open social network. It provides an environment where our users can share about their hobbies, interests and experiences, structured in the form of an article, lesson or course in which to educate their followers. Our social network ensures that users spend their time 100% productively and instead of tiring their brains in constant "scrolling" they move it with the materials that caught their attention.
The main functionality that Umeliko has is aimed at creating, sharing and consuming useful and educational content that connects users with common interests and talents.
